Changes
=======

4.0b3 (unreleased)
------------------

- Warn when using another Python implementation than CPython as it is not safe to use RestrictedPython with other versions than CPyton.
  See https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2653 for PyPy.

4.0b2 (2017-09-15)
------------------

- Fix regression in ``RestrictionCapableEval`` which broke when using list comprehensions.


4.0b1 (2017-09-15)
------------------

- Security issue: RestrictedPython now ships with a default implementation for
  ``_getattr_`` which prevents from using the ``format()`` method on
  str/unicode as it is not safe, see:
  http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format/

  **Caution:** If you do not already have secured the access to this
  ``format()`` method in your ``_getattr_`` implementation use
  ``RestrictedPython.Guards.safer_getattr()`` in your implementation to
  benefit from this fix.

- Drop the old implementation of version 3.x: `RCompile.py`,
  `SelectCompiler.py`, `MutatingWorker.py`, `RestrictionMutator.py` and
  `tests/verify.py`.

- Drop support for PyPy as there currently is no way to restrict the builtins.
  See https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2653.

- Remove ``__len__`` method in ``.Guards._write_wrapper`` because it is no
  longer reachable by code using the wrapper.


4.0a3 (2017-06-20)
------------------

- Fix install problem caused by an invisible non-ASCII character in
  `README.rst`.

- Update configurations to give better feedback and helpful reports.



4.0a2 (2017-05-26)
------------------

- Modified README and setup.py to provide a better desciption test for PyPI.
  [loechel]

- Drop support for long-deprecated ``sets`` module.
  [tseaver]


4.0a1 (2017-05-05)
------------------

- Mostly complete rewrite based on Python AST module.
  [loechel (Alexander Loechel), icemac (Michael Howitz), stephan-hof (Stephan Hofmockel), tlotze (Thomas Lotze)]

- switch to pytest

- The ``compile_restricted*`` functions now return a
  ``namedtuple CompileResult`` instead of a simple ``tuple``.


3.6.0 (2010-07-09)
------------------

- Add name check for names assigned during imports using the
  ``from x import y`` format.

- Add test for name check when assigning an alias using multiple-context
  ``with`` statements in Python 2.7.

- Add tests for protection of the iterators for dict and set comprehensions
  in Python 2.7.

3.6.0a1 (2010-06-05)
--------------------

- Remove support for ``DocumentTemplate.sequence`` - this is handled in the
  DocumentTemplate package itself.

3.5.2 (2010-04-30)
------------------

- Remove a testing dependency on ``zope.testing``.

3.5.1 (2009-03-17)
------------------

- Add tests for ``Utilities`` module.

3.5.0 (2009-02-09)
------------------

- Drop legacy support for Python 2.1 / 2.2 (``__future__`` imports
  of ``nested_scopes`` / ``generators``.).

3.4.3 (2008-10-26)
------------------

- Fix deprecation warning: ``with`` is now a reserved keyword on
  Python 2.6. That means RestrictedPython should run on Python 2.6
  now. Thanks to Ranjith Kannikara, GSoC Student for the patch.

- Add tests for ternary if expression and for ``with`` keyword and
  context managers.

3.4.2 (2007-07-28)
------------------

- Improve ``README.txt``.

3.4.1 (2007-06-23)

------------------
