============================================
Welcome to RestrictedPython's documentation!
============================================

RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python language which allows to provide a program input into a trusted environment.
RestrictedPython is not a sandbox system or a secured environment, but it helps to define a trusted environment and execute untrusted code inside of it.

Supported Python versions
=========================

RestrictedPython supports CPython 3.7 up to 3.12.
It does _not_ support PyPy or other alternative Python implementations.
