Installing This Package
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

The installation steps below assume that you have the cool new 'setuptools'
package installed in your Python.  Here is where to get it:

  $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
  $ /path/to/your/python ez_setup.py # req. write access to 'site-packages'

Installing a Development Checkout
---------------------------------

Check out the package from subversion:

  $ svn co svn+ssh://svn.zope.org/repos/main/RestrictedPython/trunk \
    src/RestrictedPython
  $ cd src/RestrictedPython

Install it as a "devlopment egg" (which also installs its "hard"
dependencies):

  $ /path/to/your/python setup.py devel

The installation of dependency eggs uses the 'setup.cfg' file in
the checkout.  You can supply '--find-links' on the command line to
point it at a non-standard package repository.


Running the Tests
-----------------

To test the package, you will also need the 'zope.testing' package, which
can't (yet) be automatically installed.  Eventually, you should be able to
type:

  $ /path/to/your/python setup.py test

and have it install the "testing dependencies."  Today, the workaround
is to install it manually:

  $ /path/to/easy_install --find-links="...." zope.testing

You can then run the tests (finally) from the checkout directory:

  $ /path/to/your/python test.py
    Running:
      .............
    Ran 13 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.094 seconds.


Installing a Source Distribution
--------------------------------

You can also install it from a source distribution:

  $ /path/to/easy_install --find-links="...." -eb src RestrictedPython
  $ cd src/RestrictedPython
  $ /path/to/your/python setup.py devel


Installing a Binary Egg
-----------------------

Install the package as a "binary egg" (which also installs its "hard"
dependencies):

  $ /path/to/easy_install --find-links="...." RestrictedPython
